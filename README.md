- Raw HTML/CSS/JS (no frameworks)
- Flask
  - Email Validator

Flask is doing most of the heavy lifting. There is no JS in the site that actually contributes to the site's interactivity and functionality; it's just for what's inside the console, so Flask handles what you'd expect JS to.

If you're curious about the overall codebase, look at the `tokei.txt` file, which is updated using [`tokei`](https://github.com/XAMPPRocky/tokei).
